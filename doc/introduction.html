        The development and exchange of a mathematical model usually requires several steps:

        <UL>
            <LI>Write some model ideas on paper;
            <LI>Implement these ideas in C++, Fortran, MATLAB, etc.;
            <LI>Write and submit a manuscript which describes the model and includes its mathematical formulations;
            <LI>The manuscript gets accepted and published; and
            <LI>The manuscript is read and the model implemented by one or several people.
        </UL>

        However, each of these steps is subject to human error.

        <SPAN CLASS = "SectionFont">CellML</SPAN>

        <BR><BR>

        To address the above problem, <A HREF = "http://www.bioeng.auckland.ac.nz/">Prof. Peter Hunter's group</A> (Auckland, New Zealand) has, in August 2001, released version 1.0 of the specifications of the <A HREF = "http://www.cellml.org/">CellML</A> language, before releasing a refined version (1.1) in February 2006.

        <BR><BR>

        CellML supports the definition and sharing of models through an <A HREF = "http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</A>-based language, and provides a consistent mathematical representation of a model through <A HREF = "http://www.w3.org/Math/">MathML</A>. CellML models are thus independent of the operating system or programming language used by the user, and model equations can be generated and published from the CellML code. Model evolution and re-use are strongly encouraged (and are possible using CellML 1.1).

        <SPAN CLASS = "SectionFont">OpenCOR</SPAN>

        <BR><BR>

        OpenCOR is a cross-platform CellML-based modelling environment which has, from its inception, been developed with modellers, experimentalists and teachers/students in mind. It tries to alleviate all of the complexity associated with CellML by providing a user-friendly way to organise, edit, simulate and analyse CellML files.
