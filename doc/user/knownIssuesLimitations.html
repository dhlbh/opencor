        <p>
            Please note that the following known issues/limitations have been observed on <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/">Windows</a> 7, <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> 11.04 (Natty Narwhal; both 32-bit and 64-bit) and <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a> 10.6 (Snow Leopard). So, if you use a different operating system, these issues/limitations may or not be relevant to you.
        </p>

        <p>
            By default, OpenCOR uses your system's language for menus, dialog boxes, etc., as long as it is either English or French (please <a href="user/contactUs.html">contact us</a> if you would like another language to be added). If your system uses another language, then OpenCOR will default to English. Otherwise, if you specifically specify English or French as the language to be used by OpenCOR, then please be aware that system messages, dialog boxes, etc. will be displayed in your system's language.
        </p>

                OpenCOR's embedded file browser may, on some computers, result in OpenCOR being slow to respond at startup. This is, unfortunately, a very well-known problem with Windows and for which there are <a href="http://www.brighthub.com/computing/windows-platform/articles/86552.aspx">several known causes and solutions</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Resetting all the user settings (by selecting the <code>Tools|Reset All</code> menu) requires restarting OpenCOR. There may, however, be times when OpenCOR will have to restarted manually. We believe this to be a problem with Windows (indeed, this problem has not been seen on neither Linux nor Mac OS X), even though we have yet to find its cause.
            </li>

        <p>
            Depending on your window manager (e.g. <a href="http://www.compiz.org/">Compiz</a>), OpenCOR may or not experience one of the following issues/limitations (none of which affect the good functioning of the software itself):
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Upon starting OpenCOR, the software will try to retrieve your previous session's settings which may result in the main window showing up lower down the screen than it should.</li>
            <li>To show the help window by pressing the <code>F1</code> key may, if the help window is floating (as opposed to being docked to the main window), result in OpenCOR not being the active application anymore. This means that if you were to press the <code>F1</code> key one more time, then the help window would remain visible while it should have disappeared.</li>
            <li>
                Menu items that have sub-menus may not, on some versions of <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a>, have their icon displayed (should they normally have one). This has been discussed in many places, such as <a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/02/missing-menu-icons-what-are-gnome-playing-at/">here</a> and <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1505270">here</a>. Anyway, one way to change this behaviour is to enter the following on the command line:
                <pre>$ gconftool-2 --type Boolean --set /desktop/gnome/interface/menus_have_icons True</pre>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Note that the above issues have nothing to do with OpenCOR itself (everything works fine on both Windows and Mac OS X), but with the window manager that you use. Indeed, there is a lack of compliancy between the various window managers, so something that works with one window manager may or not work with another, as is unfortunately the case here.
