ADD_DEFINITIONS(-DQXT_STATIC)
# Note: the above is just to 'fool' LibQxt in believing that we want a static
#       version of the library. In fact, we want a shared version, but if we
#       were not to define QXT_STATIC, then LibQxt would define its classes to
#       be imported/exported (on Windows) while we prefer to take care of that
#       through the enable-auto-import option during linking (since this means
#       that we don't have to worry about imports/exports of DLL functions),
#       so...
