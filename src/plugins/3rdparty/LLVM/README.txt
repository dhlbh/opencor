We want and need to build OpenCOR using MSVC on Windows, as well as have a shared library version of LLVM so that it can be used as a 'proper' plugin. The problem with the latter is that it's not possible to build LLVM as a shared library using MSVC (because of the need to specify qualify classes as __declspec(dllexport) or __declspec(dllimport) depending on whether LLVM is being built or referenced, respectively.

To address this shortcoming, we maunally qualify the classes that are currently needed by OpenCOR (grep for ---OPENCOR--- to find out which ones those are). Should OpenCOR ever need direct access to another class, then that class will obviously have to be qualified and LLVM rebuilt.

To build LLVM is time consuming and therefore not something we want to do everytime we build OpenCOR. We therefore have two CMakeLists.txt files:
 - CMakeLists.txt: this is our 'proper' CMakeLists.txt file and the one which is to be used by default and once a binary version of the LLVM plugin exists (such a binary is located in either the windows, linux or macosx folder under [LLVM]/bin).
 - CMakeLists.txt.build: this CMakeLists.txt file should be used whenever LLVM needs to be rebuilt. Once this is done, use of the 'proper' CMakeLists.txt should be resumed.

Note: LLVM's config files were generated using CMake:
          cd <LLVM-SOURCE_CODE>
          mkdir build
          cd build
          cmake ..
      From there, the config files were manually copied over. They can be found in the windows, linux and macosx folders under [LLVM]/include/llvm/Config and [LLVM]/include/llvm/Support.

OLD README.txt

Ideally, our LLVM plugin would work in a way similar to that of, say, the QJson plugin, i.e. the plugin itself would contain all of LLVM. However, this cannot easily be done, not least because LLVM is a big library. So, instead, we do something similar to the CellML API plugin, i.e. build LLVM as a shared library and deploy it that way while use the plugin itself to get access to LLVM's classes, methods, etc.

Note that to build a shared version of LLVM using CMake is not possible on Windows and is not recommended on other operating systems (see http://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html). We therefore had to rely on LLVM's other and prefered build system: Autotools. There shouldn't be a need for you to build LLVM. Still, should you want to build it on Linux and/or Mac OS X, then you should be fine as long as you are all set to build OpenCOR on those systems (see doc/developer/preRequirements.html). However, on Windows, your Qt environment will not be sufficient. We would therefore recommend building LLVM using a virtual machine (so as not to mess up your Qt environment) which first involves installing the following:
 - MinGW/MSYS (see http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/): select C++ Compiler, MSYS Basic System and MinGW Developer ToolKit in the list of components to install;
 - Python (see http://www.python.org/download/; you want version 2.7.2 not 3.x): make sure that Python is accessible from a shell prompt, e.g. export PATH=/c/Python27:$PATH.

From there, you need to get LLVM's source code (see http://www.llvm.org/releases/) and from a shell prompt:
    cd <WHERE-llvm-3.0.tar.gz-IS>
    tar xvzf llvm-3.0.tar.gz
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ../llvm-3.0.src/configure --disable-docs --enable-optimized --enable-shared --enable-targets=host
    make
